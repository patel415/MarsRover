EPICS Mars Rover
=========
This project is part of the Purdue EPICS program; which includes a Mars Rover built based on the Curiosity Rover, currently on Mars. 
The Rover consists of a Sasquatch Robot Controller, created by Team 221 (http://www.team221.com/) which is based on Arduino. Check out their github to download the necessary libraries: https://github.com/221robotics
Download the RobotOpen Sasquatch Library (https://github.com/221robotics/RobotOpen-Sasquatch-Library) and follow the instructions on (http://www.team221.com/robotopen/gs.html).
Other parts include motors, servos, cameras and in the future, sensors and a robotic arm (which has been built and sits in the EPICS AAEE locker). All of the documentation for these parts is available for Purdue EPICS students on the EPICS sharepoint server.
The end goal for the Rover is to be placed in an enclosure with a virtually unlimited power source. The rover should be able to be controlled by a website, which is under development.
Contact Purdue EPICS AAEE for more details.
